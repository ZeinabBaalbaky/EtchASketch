# EtchASketch
it's a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs initially created using javascript
 A “hover” effect is setted up so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them
 A button is added to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup
 asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the new grid is generated in
 the same total space as before so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
 The limit for the user input is a maximum of 100.
